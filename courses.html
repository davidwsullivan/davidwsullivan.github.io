<h3>Lower-Level General Studies Courses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PHI 1010 - The Big Questions: An Introduction to Philosophy</li>
    <p><small>Philosophy asks questions such as: What am I? How can I know things? What is real? Does God exist? Students confront questions like these in a rigorous, critical, and open-ended manner. Philosophy is unlike other disciplines: students learn not just what others have discovered, but also how to think about themselves, the world, and the relation between them.</small></p>
  <li>PHI 1030 - Thinking about Ethics: Morality and the Good Life</li>
  <p><small>Have you ever had a hard time deciding the right thing to do? In this course, students learn how to think more critically about moral values and develop their own perspectives while considering questions such as: “How should I best live my life?” “What should I value?”, “How can I best determine right from wrong?”, “What does social justice require?”, and “What do we owe to each other?”</small></p>
  <li>PHI 2040 - Philosophy of Religion</li>
  <p><small>This is a course on the philosophical dimensions of religious faith, belief, and/or practice; the nature and scope of religious experiences; and/or the existence and/or source of divinity.</small></p>
</ul>
<h3>Upper-Level General Studies Courses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PHI 3000 - History of Ancient Philosophy</li>
  <p><small>This course is a survey of the history of ancient philosophy, focusing on the Greeks. The life and work of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle receive special attention.</small></p>
  <li>PHI 3010 - History of Medieval Philosophy: Islamic, Jewish, and Christian Voices</li>
  <p><small>Students in this course explore the major themes, figures, and texts of medieval philosophy (circa 325 to 1450) in North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe. Topics include the reception of Greek thought into Arabic and Latin, the relationship between reason and revealed religion, and arguments about the existence and attributes of God, necessity and freedom, and whether the world is eternal. Students examine Muslim, Jewish, and Christian thinkers (e.g. Augustine, Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Maimonides, Aquinas, Hildegard of Bingen) and investigate their intellectual context, interrelationships, and influences.</small></p>
  <li>PHI 3020 - History of Modern Philosophy</li>
  <p><small>This course is a survey of the history of modern philosophy, from the Renaissance to Romanticism. The work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant receive special attention.</small></p>
</ul>
<h3>Upper Level Philosophy Courses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>PHI 3390 - Aesthetics</li>
  <p><small>A study of some basic concepts of aesthetics, focused either on a principal figure in the field (e.g. Plato, Kant, Schiller, or Nietzsche) or on a particular set of fundamental issues in aesthetics, e.g. the ontology of the work of art, intentions and originality, form and expression, criticism, aesthetic education, etc. May include an emphasis on a particular art (e.g. poetry, drama, film, jazz, or painting).</small></p>
  <li>PHI 3530 - Philosophy of Mind</li>
  <p><small>This course is a study of mental phenomena, including traditional problems connected with the relation of mind and body, personal identity, solipsism and the knowledge of other minds, but also contemporary issues involving consciousness, perception, thought, feeling and volition in human, animal, and artificial contexts.</small></p>
  <li>PHI 3550 - Existentialism</li>
  <p><small>Existentialism may be characterized as a philosophical and literary impulse, a multi-sided revolt against the “leveling down” of human existence by forces of industrialization, alienation, and homogenization. In the ideologies of mass society, existentialists identify a series of threats to human freedom and to the uniqueness of the individual. This course examines several approaches to a cluster of philosophical problems, rooted in the concrete realities of human existence.</small></p>
